###
The modification to the original repository is the modification of the indoor_eval file, which is used to save the results of the OD of each object for each scene under tr3d/data/sunrgbd/ODResults using the pickle file.

### Installation
This implementation is based on [mmdetection3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) framework.
Please refer to the original installation guide [getting_started.md](docs/en/getting_started.md), including MinkowskiEngine installation, replacing `open-mmlab/mmdetection3d` with `weishuaiSong/tr3dodresult`. 

'''python
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
mim install mmsegmentation
git clone https://github.com/weishuaiSong/tr3dodresult
cd tr3dodresult
pip install -e .
'''


### Getting Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for basic usage examples.
We follow the mmdetection3d data preparation protocol described in [scannet](data/scannet), [sunrgbd](data/sunrgbd), and [s3dis](data/s3dis).



### 
use test to storage od on test set of sunrgb，You need to prepare the data and download the checkpoint in advance.

Test pre-trained model using [test](tools/dist_test.sh) with TR3D [configs](configs/tr3d):
```shell
python tools/test.py configs/tr3d/tr3d_sunrgbd-3d-10class.py checkpoints/tr3d_sunrgbd.pth --eval mAP
```
The obtained file will be stored separately under tr3d/data/sunrgbd/ODResults, with the same name as the corresponding point cloud, and the content of the storage is a dictionary, the corresponding key is the object id, and the value is whether or not the object has been detected, and if it is then 1 otherwise 0.
